Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `i`-th paper, return the researcher's **h-index**.

The h-index is defined as: the maximum value of `h` such that the researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]
Output: 3

Sort descending: [6, 5, 3, 1, 0]

  i (papers seen)   citations[i]   >= i+1 ?
  1                 6              >= 1  YES
  2                 5              >= 2  YES
  3                 3              >= 3  YES
  4                 1              >= 4  NO   ← stop

Answer = 3 (3 papers with >= 3 citations each)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1, 3, 1]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

## Thinking Process

### What Are We Really Looking For?

This is **not** about total citations. It's about finding a **balance point**: the largest `h` where at least `h` papers have `>= h` citations.

### Why Sorting Works

After sorting in descending order:
- **Position `i+1`** = number of papers we've seen so far
- **Value `citations[i]`** = the citation count of the current paper

At each position, we're asking: "Does this paper have enough citations to support the current count of papers?"

The moment `citations[i] < i + 1`, the balance breaks and we've found our answer.

```
Sorted: [6, 5, 3, 1, 0]

Index 0: 6 >= 1  →  at least 1 paper with >= 1 citations  ✓
Index 1: 5 >= 2  →  at least 2 papers with >= 2 citations ✓
Index 2: 3 >= 3  →  at least 3 papers with >= 3 citations ✓
Index 3: 1 >= 4  →  at least 4 papers with >= 4 citations ✗  ← STOP

h = 3
```

### Can We Do Better Than O(n log n)?

Yes — since `h` can be at most `n`, we can bucket citation counts and scan in linear time.

### Counting Sort — O(n) time, O(n) space

Any citation count above `n` cannot increase the h-index (we only have `n` papers), so clamp each count to `min(c, n)` and build a frequency array of size `n + 1`. Scan from `h = n` down to `0`, accumulating how many papers have at least `h` citations:

```
citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], n = 5
Buckets (after clamp): 0→1, 1→1, 3→1, 5→1  (6 clamped to 5)

h = 5: papers with ≥5 citations = 1  →  1 < 5
h = 4: papers with ≥4 citations = 1  →  1 < 4
h = 3: papers with ≥3 citations = 3  →  3 ≥ 3  ✓  answer = 3
```

## Comparison

| Aspect | Sorting | Counting Sort |
|---|---|---|
| Time | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Space | O(1) (in-place sort) | O(n) (frequency array) |
| Interview preference | Most common, easy to explain | Good follow-up for optimization |
| Key idea | Descending order gives "papers seen" naturally | Bucket citations, scan from top |

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Sort + greedy** *(this problem)* | O(n log n) | O(1) | Interval scheduling, assignment |
| Local greedy choice | O(n) | O(1) | Jump game, gas station |
| Greedy + heap | O(n log n) | O(n) | Merge streams, room allocation |
| Exchange argument | O(n) | O(1) | Prove greedy choice is safe |

## Solution

### Sort Descending — O(n log n)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end(), greater<int>());
        for (int i = 0; i < citations.size(); ++i) {
            if (citations[i] < i + 1) return i;
        }
        return citations.size();
    }
};
```

### Counting Sort — O(n) time, O(n) space

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        vector<int> count(n + 1, 0);
        for (int c : citations) {
            count[min(c, n)]++;
        }
        int papers = 0;
        for (int h = n; h >= 0; --h) {
            papers += count[h];
            if (papers >= h) return h;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Sort descending, then scan until the balance breaks.

**Key idea:** After sorting descending, index `i` represents `i + 1` papers seen. The first position where `citations[i] < i + 1` means we cannot support `i + 1` papers with that many citations — so the answer is `i`.

**How the code works:**
- Sort with `greater<int>()` so the highest citations come first.
- At index `i`, we have `i + 1` papers; if the smallest among them (`citations[i]`) is still `>= i + 1`, the h-index is at least `i + 1`.
- When `citations[i] < i + 1`, return `i` (the largest valid h-index).
- If every paper passes the check, return `n`.

**Walkthrough** — `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`, expected output `3`:

1. Sort descending → `[6, 5, 3, 1, 0]`.
2. `i = 0`: `6 >= 1` ✓ · `i = 1`: `5 >= 2` ✓ · `i = 2`: `3 >= 3` ✓.
3. `i = 3`: `1 < 4` → return `3`.

## Common Mistakes

- **Confusing h-index with max citations:** `h` is bounded by the number of papers, not the citation values
- **Off-by-one in sorting approach:** Position `i` means `i + 1` papers (0-indexed), so the check is `citations[i] < i + 1`
- **Forgetting the `min(c, n)` clamp in counting sort:** Any citation count `>= n` is equivalent since `h <= n`

## Key Takeaways

- The h-index is a **balance point** between quantity (number of papers) and quality (citation count)
- Sort descending and scan gives the most intuitive solution
- Counting sort exploits the fact that `h <= n` to achieve linear time
- This pattern of "find the largest k satisfying a threshold" appears in many problems
