There are `n` people standing in a queue numbered from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right. You are given an array `heights` of **distinct** integers where `heights[i]` represents the height of the `i-th` person.

A person `i` can see person `j` (where `i < j`) if everyone between them is **shorter** than both of them. More formally, person `i` can see person `j` if:
*   `i < j`, and
*   `min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i + 1], heights[i + 2], ..., heights[j - 1])`.

Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the **number of people** the `i-th` person can see to their **right** in the queue.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]
Output: [3,1,2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
- Person 0 can see person 1, 2, and 4.
  - Person 3 is blocked by person 2.
  - Person 5 is blocked by person 4.
- Person 1 can see person 2.
- Person 2 can see person 3 and 4.
- Person 3 can see person 4.
- Person 4 can see person 5.
- Person 5 can see no one since nobody is to the right of them.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,10]
Output: [4,1,1,1,0]
```

## Constraints

*   `n == heights.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5`
*   All the values of `heights` are **unique**.

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Monotonic stack** *(this problem)* | O(n) | O(n) | Next greater/smaller element |
| Parentheses matching | O(n) | O(n) | Push open, pop on close |
| Expression evaluation | O(n) | O(n) | Operand + operator stacks |
| Stack simulation | O(n) | O(n) | Process in LIFO order |

## Thinking Process

We maintain a **monotonic decreasing stack** from right to left.

1.  Iterate through the `heights` array from right to left (n-1 down to 0).
2.  For each person i:
    *   While the stack is not empty and the current person `heights[i]` is taller than the person at the top of the stack `st.top()`:
        *   Person i can see `st.top()`.
        *   Pop `st.top()` and increment the count for person i.
        *   Why? Because `st.top()` was the shortest person currently available to the right, and `heights[i]` blocks anyone behind them from seeing `st.top()`, but person i sees them.
    *   If the stack is still not empty after the pops:
        *   Person i can see the current `st.top()` (who is taller than `heights[i]`).
        *   Increment the count for person i.
        *   This person blocks person i from seeing anyone further to the right.
    *   Push the current person `heights[i]` onto the stack.

## Solution Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> canSeePersonsCount(vector<int>& heights) {
        int n = heights.size();
        vector<int> rtn(n, 0);
        stack<int> st;
        
        // Iterate from right to left
        for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Person i can see everyone in the stack that is shorter than them
            while(!st.empty() && heights[i] > st.top()) {
                st.pop();
                rtn[i]++;
            }
            // If there's someone left in the stack, they are taller than person i
            // Person i can see this taller person, but no one beyond them
            if(!st.empty()) {
                rtn[i]++;
            }
            // Push current height to maintain monotonic decreasing stack (from top)
            st.push(heights[i]);
        }
        return rtn;
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Monotonic stack (this problem)

**Key idea:** We maintain a **monotonic decreasing stack** from right to left.

**How the code works:**
1.  Iterate through the `heights` array from right to left (n-1 down to 0).
2.  For each person i:
*   While the stack is not empty and the current person `heights[i]` is taller than the person at the top of the stack `st.top()`:
*   Person i can see `st.top()`.
*   Pop `st.top()` and increment the count for person i.
*   Why? Because `st.top()` was the shortest person currently available to the right, and `heights[i]` blocks anyone behind them from seeing `st.top()`, but person i sees them.

**Walkthrough** — input `heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]`, expected output `[3,1,2,1,1,0]`:

- Person 0 can see person 1, 2, and 4.
  - Person 3 is blocked by person 2.
  - Person 5 is blocked by person 4.
- Person 1 can see person 2.
- Person 2 can see person 3 and 4.
- Person 3 can see person 4.
- Person 4 can see person 5.
- Person 5 can see no one since nobody is to the right of them.

*   **Time Complexity**: O(n). Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
*   **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the stack and the result array.
## Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through **Example 1**: `heights = [10, 6, 8, 5, 11, 9]`

We process from **right to left** (i = 5 to 0):

| Step (i) | Height | Stack (top at right) | Logic | Pop Count | Visible | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | 9 | `[]` | Stack is empty | 0 | **0** | Push 9 |
| 4 | 11 | `[9]` | 11 > 9, pop 9 | 1 | 1 + 0 = **1** | Push 11 |
| 3 | 5 | `[11]` | 5 < 11, don't pop | 0 | 0 + 1 = **1** | Push 5 |
| 2 | 8 | `[11, 5]` | 8 > 5, pop 5 | 1 | 1 + 1 = **2** | Push 8 |
| 1 | 6 | `[11, 8]` | 6 < 8, don't pop | 0 | 0 + 1 = **1** | Push 6 |
| 0 | 10 | `[11, 8, 6]` | 10 > 6, 10 > 8, pop both | 2 | 2 + 1 = **3** | Push 10 |

**Final Result**: `[3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]`

### Why this works:
1.  **Popping shorter people**: If current person i is taller than person j on the stack, person i can definitely see person j. Person j is then removed because anyone to the left of person i will have their view of person j blocked by person i.
2.  **The "+1" logic**: After popping everyone shorter, if the stack isn't empty, the person at the top is the first person taller than current person i. Person i can see this person, but they block person i from seeing anyone further right.

### Complexity
*   **Time Complexity**: O(n). Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
*   **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the stack and the result array.

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping edge cases (empty input, single element, boundaries).
- Off-by-one errors in loops and index ranges.
- Forgetting to handle the case when no valid answer exists.

## Key Takeaways

- **Pattern:** Monotonic stack (this problem)
- While the stack is not empty and the current person `heights[i]` is taller than the person at the top of the stack `st.top()`:
- Person i can see `st.top()`.
