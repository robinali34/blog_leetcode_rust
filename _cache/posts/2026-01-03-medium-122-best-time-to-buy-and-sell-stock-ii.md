You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return *the **maximum profit** you can achieve*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## Thinking Process

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

- Define state: what subproblem does `dp[i]` (or `dp[i][j]`) represent?
- Recurrence: how does the answer build from smaller indices?
- Base cases first; optimize space if only prior row/layer is needed.

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **1D DP** *(this problem)* | O(n) | O(n) or O(1) | Linear recurrence |
| 2D DP | O(nm) | O(nm) or O(n) | Grid or two-sequence problems |
| State machine DP | O(n) | O(1) | Buy/sell, hold/not-hold states |
| Memoization (top-down) | Same as DP | O(n) | Recursive + cache |

## Solution

### **Solution: Greedy - Capture All Gains**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if(prices.size() == 0) return 0;
        int maxProfit = 0, lastPrice = prices[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < (int)prices.size(); i++) {
            maxProfit += max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** 1D DP (this problem)

**Key idea:** You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day.

**How the code works:**
- Define state: what subproblem does `dp[i]` (or `dp[i][j]`) represent?
- Recurrence: how does the answer build from smaller indices?
- Base cases first; optimize space if only prior row/layer is needed.

**Walkthrough** — input `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`, expected output `7`:

Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

**Time:** O(n) where n is the length of prices array · **Space:** O(1)

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Edge Case (Line 4)**:
   - If prices array is empty, return 0 (no profit possible)

2. **Initialize (Line 5)**:
   - `maxProfit`: Accumulator for total profit (starts at 0)
   - `lastPrice`: Previous day's price (initialized but not used in this version)

3. **Calculate Profit (Lines 6-8)**:
   - **For each day** starting from index 1:
     - **Calculate difference**: `prices[i] - prices[i - 1]`
     - **Add positive gains**: `max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1])`
       - If price increased, add the gain to profit
       - If price decreased or stayed same, add 0
     - **Accumulate**: Add to `maxProfit`

4. **Return (Line 9)**:
   - Return total accumulated profit

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`**

```
Initial: maxProfit = 0

i=1: prices[1]=1, prices[0]=7
  Difference: 1 - 7 = -6
  Gain: max(0, -6) = 0
  maxProfit = 0 + 0 = 0

i=2: prices[2]=5, prices[1]=1
  Difference: 5 - 1 = 4
  Gain: max(0, 4) = 4
  maxProfit = 0 + 4 = 4

i=3: prices[3]=3, prices[2]=5
  Difference: 3 - 5 = -2
  Gain: max(0, -2) = 0
  maxProfit = 4 + 0 = 4

i=4: prices[4]=6, prices[3]=3
  Difference: 6 - 3 = 3
  Gain: max(0, 3) = 3
  maxProfit = 4 + 3 = 7

i=5: prices[5]=4, prices[4]=6
  Difference: 4 - 6 = -2
  Gain: max(0, -2) = 0
  maxProfit = 7 + 0 = 7

Result: 7
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
Prices: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
         ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓
Day:     0  1  2  3  4  5

Gains:
  Day 0→1: 1-7 = -6 (loss, ignore)
  Day 1→2: 5-1 = +4 (gain, capture) ✓
  Day 2→3: 3-5 = -2 (loss, ignore)
  Day 3→4: 6-3 = +3 (gain, capture) ✓
  Day 4→5: 4-6 = -2 (loss, ignore)

Total: 4 + 3 = 7
```

**Example 2: `prices = [1,2,3,4,5]`**

```
Initial: maxProfit = 0

i=1: 2-1 = 1 → maxProfit = 1
i=2: 3-2 = 1 → maxProfit = 2
i=3: 4-3 = 1 → maxProfit = 3
i=4: 5-4 = 1 → maxProfit = 4

Result: 4
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
Prices: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Gains:  +1 +1 +1 +1
Total:  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
```

**Example 3: `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`**

```
Initial: maxProfit = 0

i=1: 6-7 = -1 → maxProfit = 0
i=2: 4-6 = -2 → maxProfit = 0
i=3: 3-4 = -1 → maxProfit = 0
i=4: 1-3 = -2 → maxProfit = 0

Result: 0 (no positive gains)
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Why Greedy Works**

The greedy strategy is optimal because:
1. **No Future Information**: We don't need to know future prices
2. **Local Optimal**: Capturing every price increase is always beneficial
3. **No Regret**: If we skip a gain today, we can't capture it later (each day is independent)
4. **Optimal Substructure**: Maximum profit = sum of all positive day-to-day gains

### **Key Insight: Capture All Gains**

Instead of trying to find the best buy/sell pairs, we can:
- **Buy and sell on consecutive days** whenever price increases
- **Sum all positive differences** to get maximum profit
- This is equivalent to buying at local minima and selling at local maxima

**Example:**
```
Prices: [1, 5, 3, 6]

Strategy 1: Buy at 1, sell at 5, buy at 3, sell at 6
  Profit: (5-1) + (6-3) = 4 + 3 = 7

Strategy 2: Buy at 1, sell at 6 (skip intermediate)
  Profit: 6-1 = 5

Strategy 3: Capture all gains (greedy)
  Day 0→1: 5-1 = 4
  Day 1→2: 3-5 = -2 (ignore)
  Day 2→3: 6-3 = 3
  Total: 4 + 3 = 7 ✓
```

### **Mathematical Proof**

For any price sequence, the maximum profit is:
```
maxProfit = Σ max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1]) for i from 1 to n-1
```

This captures all positive price movements, which is optimal.

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of prices array
  - Single pass through the array
  - Constant time operations for each element
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using a few variables
  - No additional data structures

## Key Points

1. **Greedy Strategy**: Capture every price increase
2. **Simple Logic**: Sum all positive day-to-day differences
3. **Optimal**: Greedy approach finds maximum profit
4. **No DP Needed**: Simple greedy is sufficient
5. **Efficient**: O(n) time, O(1) space

## Common Mistakes

1. **Empty array**: `[]` → return 0
2. **Single price**: `[5]` → return 0 (no transaction possible)
3. **All increasing**: `[1,2,3,4,5]` → return 4
4. **All decreasing**: `[5,4,3,2,1]` → return 0
5. **Constant prices**: `[5,5,5,5]` → return 0
6. **Mixed**: `[7,1,5,3,6,4]` → return 7

1. **Wrong logic**: Trying to find single best buy/sell pair
2. **Missing edge case**: Not handling empty array
3. **Wrong index**: Off-by-one errors in loop
4. **Negative profit**: Not using `max(0, ...)` to ignore losses
5. **Complex solution**: Using DP when greedy is sufficient
