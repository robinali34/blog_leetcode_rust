Given an array of meeting time intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, determine if a person could attend all meetings.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: false
Explanation: [0,30] overlaps with [5,10] (and with [15,20]), so the person cannot attend all.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: No overlap; the person can attend all meetings.
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti < endi <= 10^6`

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Prefix sum** *(this problem)* | O(n) | O(n) | Range queries, subarray sum |
| Sort + scan | O(n log n) | O(1) | Intervals, meeting rooms |
| Kadane's algorithm | O(n) | O(1) | Maximum subarray |
| Hash map counting | O(n) | O(n) | Frequency, two-sum variants |

## Thinking Process

Sort intervals by start time. After sorting, any overlap must appear between **consecutive** meetings — if `intervals[i].start < intervals[i-1].end`, the person is double-booked.

## Solution — O(n log n) time, O(log n) space

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canAttendMeetings(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Prefix sum (this problem)

**Key idea:** Sort intervals by start time. After sorting, any overlap must appear between **consecutive** meetings — if `intervals[i].start < intervals[i-1].end`, the person is double-booked.

**Walkthrough** — input `intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]`, expected output `false`:

[0,30] overlaps with [5,10] (and with [15,20]), so the person cannot attend all.

**Time:** O(n log n) · **Space:** O(\log n)

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping edge cases (empty input, single element, boundaries).
- Off-by-one errors in loops and index ranges.
- Forgetting to handle the case when no valid answer exists.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Sort by start:** After sorting, overlaps can only occur between adjacent intervals.
2. **Overlap condition:** Current start < previous end ⇒ overlap.
3. **Follow-up:** [253. Meeting Rooms II](https://www.leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/) asks for the minimum number of rooms (sweep line or min-heap).
