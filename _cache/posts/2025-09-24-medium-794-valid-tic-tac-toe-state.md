This is a simulation problem that requires understanding the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe and validating whether a given board state is possible. The key insight is checking the count of X's and O's, and ensuring that winning conditions are valid.

Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as an array of strings, return whether this board state is valid.

A Tic-Tac-Toe board is valid if:
1. The number of X's and O's follows the game rules
2. Only one player can win
3. If X wins, there should be exactly one more X than O
4. If O wins, there should be equal number of X's and O's

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
Input: board = ["O  ","   ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: The first player always plays "X".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: board = ["XOX"," X ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: Players take turns making moves.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: board = ["XXX","   ","OOO"]
Output: false
Explanation: Both players win at the same time.
```

## Constraints
- board.length == 3
- board[i].length == 3
- board[i][j] is either 'X', 'O', or ' '

## Thinking Process

The solution involves checking several conditions:

1. **Count Validation**: Count X's and O's - X should have equal or one more count than O
2. **Win Detection**: Check if either player has won (rows, columns, diagonals)
3. **Win Validation**: 
   - If X wins, O should have exactly one less count than X
   - If O wins, X and O should have equal counts
   - Both players cannot win simultaneously

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Brute force** *(this problem)* | Often O(n^2) or O(2^n) | O(n) | Baseline; clarifies the optimization target |
| Sort + scan | O(n log n) | O(1) | Pairs, intervals, greedy ordering |
| Hash map / set | O(n) | O(n) | Frequency, membership, two-sum style |
| Single-pass linear | O(n) | O(1) | Two pointers, sliding window, Kadane |

## Solution
**Time Complexity:** O(1) - Constant time since board is always 3x3  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only using constant extra space

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validTicTacToe(vector<string>& board) {
        int x_cnt = 0, o_cnt = 0;
        for (int i= 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (auto& c : board[i]) {
                if (c == 'X') x_cnt++;
                if (c == 'O') o_cnt++;
            }
        }
        if (x_cnt != o_cnt + 1 && x_cnt != o_cnt) return false;
        bool x_win = this->win(board, 'X');
        bool o_win = this->win(board, 'O'); 
        if (x_win && o_cnt + 1 != x_cnt) return false;
        if (o_win && o_cnt != x_cnt) return false;
        if (x_win && o_win) return false;
        return true; 
    }
private:
    bool win(vector<string>& board, char P) {
        int n = board.size();
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i< n; i++) {
            cnt = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(board[i][j]== P) cnt++;
            }
            if (cnt == n) return true;
            
            cnt = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(board[j][i] == P) cnt++;
            }
            if (cnt == n) return true;
        }

        cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i< n; i++) {
            if(board[i][i] == P) cnt++;
        }
        if (cnt == n) return true;

        cnt = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if(board[i][n - i - 1] == P) cnt++;
        }
        if (cnt == n) return true;
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Brute force (this problem)

**Key idea:** The solution involves checking several conditions:

**How the code works:**
1. **Count Validation**: Count X's and O's - X should have equal or one more count than O
2. **Win Detection**: Check if either player has won (rows, columns, diagonals)
3. **Win Validation**:
- If X wins, O should have exactly one less count than X
- If O wins, X and O should have equal counts
- Both players cannot win simultaneously

**Walkthrough** — input `board = ["O  ","   ","   "]`, expected output `false`:

The first player always plays "X".
## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the solution with board = `["XOX"," X ","OOO"]`:

**Step 1:** Count X's and O's
- X count: 3 (positions: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1))
- O count: 3 (positions: (0,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2))
- Check: `x_cnt != o_cnt + 1 && x_cnt != o_cnt` → `3 != 4 && 3 != 3` → `true && false` → `false` ✓

**Step 2:** Check for wins
- X wins: Check rows, columns, diagonals → No win for X
- O wins: Row 2 has all O's → O wins ✓

**Step 3:** Validate win conditions
- O wins and `o_cnt != x_cnt` → `3 != 3` → `false` ✓
- Both X and O don't win simultaneously ✓

**Result:** Valid board state

## Common Mistakes

- Not checking if both players win simultaneously
- Incorrect count validation (allowing O to have more pieces than X)
- Missing diagonal win conditions
- Not handling edge cases like empty boards

## Key Takeaways

1. **Turn Order**: X always goes first, so X should have equal or one more count than O
2. **Win Detection**: Check all rows, columns, and both diagonals
3. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Only one player can win in a valid game
4. **Count Validation**: Winning player must have the correct count based on game rules
