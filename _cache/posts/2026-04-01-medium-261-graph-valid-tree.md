Given `n` nodes labeled `0` to `n-1` and a list of undirected `edges`, determine if these edges form a **valid tree**.

A valid tree has exactly two properties:
1. **Connected** -- all nodes are reachable from any node
2. **Acyclic** -- no cycles

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Cycle exists: 1→2→3→1
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 2000`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 5000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < n`
- No duplicate edges

## Thinking Process

### Key Observation

A graph with `n` nodes is a valid tree if and only if:
1. It has exactly `n - 1` edges
2. It is connected (or equivalently, acyclic -- with exactly `n - 1` edges, one implies the other)

**Early exit**: if `edges.size() != n - 1`, immediately return false. Too few edges means disconnected; too many means a cycle exists.

After this check, we only need to verify **one** of: connected or acyclic.

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Recursive DFS** *(this problem)* | O(n) | O(h) stack | Natural for trees and graphs |
| Iterative DFS (stack) | O(n) | O(n) | Avoid recursion depth limits |
| DFS with memoization | O(n) | O(n) | Overlapping subproblems on graphs |
| Backtracking DFS | O(2^n) typical | O(n) | Enumerate choices with pruning |

## Solution

Union each edge. If both endpoints already share the same root, we've found a cycle.
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validTree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        if (edges.size() != n - 1) return false;
        parent.resize(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) parent[i] = i;
        for (auto& e : edges) {
            int pu = find(e[0]), pv = find(e[1]);
            if (pu == pv) return false;
            parent[pu] = pv;
        }
        return true;
    }

private:
    vector<int> parent;
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Recursive DFS (this problem)

**Key idea:** ### Key Observation

**How the code works:**
1. It has exactly `n - 1` edges
2. It is connected (or equivalently, acyclic -- with exactly `n - 1` edges, one implies the other)
**Early exit**: if `edges.size() != n - 1`, immediately return false. Too few edges means disconnected; too many means a cycle exists.

**Walkthrough** — input `n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]`, expected output `true`:

1. Initialize variables from the problem setup.
2. Apply the main loop / recursion until the condition is met.
3. Confirm the result matches the expected output.
## Why `nei != parent` in DFS?

In an undirected graph, edge `(u, v)` appears in both adjacency lists. When DFS goes from `u` to `v`, looking back at `v`'s neighbors will see `u` again. Without the parent check, this would falsely report a cycle.

```
0 — 1 — 2

DFS: 0 → 1 → sees 0 (parent, skip) → 2 → sees 1 (parent, skip)
No cycle ✓
```

## Comparison

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DSU | O(n · α(n)) | O(n) | No graph construction needed |
| DFS | O(n) | O(n) | Checks connectivity + acyclicity in one pass |

Both are optimal. DSU is more concise; DFS is more intuitive for graph problems.

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting the `edges.size() != n - 1` early check (without it, DSU alone doesn't catch disconnected components)
- In DFS: not tracking parent, causing false cycle detection on undirected edges
- Assuming the graph is connected just because there are no cycles (need `n - 1` edges too)

## Key Takeaways

- **Valid tree = exactly `n - 1` edges + connected (or acyclic)**
- The edge count check is a powerful early exit that simplifies both DSU and DFS approaches
- DSU naturally detects cycles during union; DFS naturally checks connectivity during traversal
