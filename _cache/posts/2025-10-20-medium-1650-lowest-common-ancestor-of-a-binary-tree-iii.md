**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Category:** Tree, Binary Tree, LCA

Given two nodes of a binary tree `p` and `q`, return their **lowest common ancestor (LCA)**.

Each node has a reference to its parent node. The definition of LCA is: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes `p` and `q` in a tree is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

## Thinking Process

This is a variation of the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** problem where each node has a reference to its parent. The key insight is to use the **two-pointer technique** similar to finding the intersection of two linked lists.

### Algorithm:
1. **Start from both nodes** `p` and `q`
2. **Traverse upward** using parent pointers
3. **When one pointer reaches null**, redirect it to the other node
4. **Continue until both pointers meet** at the LCA
5. **Return the meeting point**

### Key Insight:
This approach ensures both pointers travel the same total distance, making them meet at the LCA.

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Recursive DFS | O(n) | O(h) | Depth, path sum, subtree queries |
| BFS level-order | O(n) | O(w) | Level traversal, zigzag |
| Inorder on BST | O(n) | O(h) | Sorted order, successor |
| **Divide & conquer on tree** *(this problem)* | O(n) | O(h) | Diameter, max path |

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* lowestCommonAncestor(Node* p, Node * q) {
        Node* a = p, *b = q;
        while(a != b) {
            a = a == nullptr ? q : a->parent;
            b = b == nullptr ? p : b->parent;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

This is a variation of the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** problem where each node has a reference to its parent. The key insight is to use the **two-pointer technique** similar to finding the intersection of two linked lists.

See **Complexity** below for time and space analysis.
## Explanation

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Initialize pointers:** `a = p`, `b = q`
2. **Traverse upward:** While `a != b`:
   - If `a` is null, redirect to `q`; otherwise move to parent
   - If `b` is null, redirect to `p`; otherwise move to parent
3. **Return meeting point:** When `a == b`, return the LCA

### Why This Works:

**Distance Equalization:**
- **Path from p to root:** Let's say it has length `m`
- **Path from q to root:** Let's say it has length `n`
- **Total distance traveled by each pointer:** `m + n`
- **Meeting point:** Both pointers meet at the LCA

**Example Walkthrough:**
For a tree where `p` is at depth 2 and `q` is at depth 3:

- **Pointer a (from p):** p → parent → root → q → parent → LCA
- **Pointer b (from q):** q → parent → parent → root → p → parent → LCA
- **Both travel same distance:** 5 steps each
- **Meet at LCA:** After equal distance traveled

### Visual Example:
```
        Root
       /    \
      A      B
     / \    / \
    C   D  E   F
   /
  G
```

If `p = G` and `q = F`:
- **Path from G to root:** G → C → A → Root (3 steps)
- **Path from F to root:** F → B → Root (2 steps)
- **Pointer a:** G → C → A → Root → F → B → Root (6 steps)
- **Pointer b:** F → B → Root → G → C → A → Root (6 steps)
- **Meet at Root:** LCA = Root

### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(h) where h is the height of the tree
- In worst case, both nodes are at maximum depth
- Each pointer travels at most 2h steps (h up + h down)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
- Only using two pointers, no additional data structures

## Key Concepts

1. **Lowest Common Ancestor:** Deepest node that has both nodes as descendants
2. **Parent Pointer:** Each node knows its parent (unlike standard binary tree)
3. **Two-Pointer Technique:** Classic algorithm pattern for finding intersections
4. **Distance Equalization:** Mathematical insight that makes the algorithm work
5. **Tree Traversal:** Upward traversal using parent pointers

This problem demonstrates the power of the two-pointer technique and shows how mathematical insights can lead to elegant solutions in tree problems.
