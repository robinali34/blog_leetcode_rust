Koko has `n` piles of bananas; the `i`-th pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards return in `h` hours. Koko can choose an integer eating speed `k` (bananas per hour). Each hour she picks one pile and eats `k` bananas from it; if the pile has fewer than `k`, she eats all of them and does not eat from another pile that hour. Return the **minimum** integer `k` such that she can finish all bananas within `h` hours.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: At speed 4: (3/4 + 6/4 + 7/4 + 11/4) = 1+2+2+3 = 8 hours.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
Explanation: She must finish in 5 hours, so speed must be at least max(piles) = 30.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
- `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

## Thinking Process

1. **Binary search on the answer:** When the answer is in a range and feasibility is easy to check, binary search on that range.

- The search space must shrink monotonically each step.
- Decide which half still satisfies the predicate, discard the other.
- Use `mid = left + (right - left) / 2` to avoid overflow.

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Standard binary search** *(this problem)* | O(log n) | O(1) | Sorted array, `left <= right` |
| Lower / upper bound | O(log n) | O(1) | First/last position, insert index |
| Binary search on rotated array | O(log n) | O(1) | Identify sorted half, discard other |
| Binary search on answer | O(n log M) | O(1) | Monotonic predicate over search space |

## Solution

Try speed 1, 2, 3, ... until total hours ≤ h.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
        int speed = 1;
        while (true) {
            int hourSpend = 0;
            for (int pile : piles) {
                hourSpend += pile / speed + (pile % speed != 0);
                if (hourSpend > h) break;
            }
            if (hourSpend <= h) return speed;
            else speed++;
        }
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Standard binary search (this problem)

**Key idea:** 1. **Binary search on the answer:** When the answer is in a range and feasibility is easy to check, binary search on that range.

**How the code works:**
1. **Binary search on the answer:** When the answer is in a range and feasibility is easy to check, binary search on that range.
- The search space must shrink monotonically each step.
- Decide which half still satisfies the predicate, discard the other.
- Use `mid = left + (right - left) / 2` to avoid overflow.

**Walkthrough** — input `piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8`, expected output `4`:

At speed 4: (3/4 + 6/4 + 7/4 + 11/4) = 1+2+2+3 = 8 hours.

**Time:** O(n × max(piles)) in the worst case — too slow for large piles. · **Space:** O(1).

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping edge cases (empty input, single element, boundaries).
- Off-by-one errors in loops and index ranges.
- Forgetting to handle the case when no valid answer exists.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Binary search on the answer:** When the answer is in a range and feasibility is easy to check, binary search on that range.
2. **Ceiling division:** `pile / k + (pile % k != 0)` or `(pile + k - 1) / k` gives hours per pile.
3. **Range:** Minimum speed is 1; maximum needed is `max(piles)` (one hour per pile).
