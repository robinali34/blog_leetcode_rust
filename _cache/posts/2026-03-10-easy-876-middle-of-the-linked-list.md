Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the **middle** node. If there are two middle nodes, return the **second** middle node.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Two middle nodes (3 and 4), return the second one.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes is in `[1, 100]`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Iterative pointer walk** *(this problem)* | O(n) | O(1) | Traversal, insertion |
| Dummy head node | O(n) | O(1) | Simplify head-edge cases |
| Reversal (3-pointer) | O(n) | O(1) | Reverse sublist or full list |
| Slow/fast pointers | O(n) | O(1) | Middle, cycle, merge lists |

## Thinking Process

### Slow & Fast Pointer

Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` is at the middle.

**Why it works:** `fast` travels at 2x speed. When `fast` has covered the full list, `slow` has covered exactly half.

### Odd vs Even Length

```
Odd (5 nodes):   1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
                          ↑ slow stops here (fast at 5, fast->next is null)

Even (6 nodes):  1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6
                              ↑ slow stops here (fast at null)
```

For even-length lists, this naturally returns the **second** middle node, matching the problem requirement.

## Approach: Slow & Fast Pointer -- O(n)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* slow = head, *fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Iterative pointer walk (this problem)

**Key idea:** ### Slow & Fast Pointer

**How the code works:**
**Why it works:** `fast` travels at 2x speed. When `fast` has covered the full list, `slow` has covered exactly half.

**Walkthrough** — input `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, expected output `[3,4,5]`:

The middle node is 3.
## Common Mistakes

- Checking only `fast->next` without checking `fast` first (null dereference on even-length lists)
- Returning the first middle for even-length lists (this problem wants the second)

## Key Takeaways

- **Slow/fast pointer** is the fundamental linked list technique -- finding the middle in one pass without knowing the length
- The loop condition `while (fast && fast->next)` handles both odd and even lengths
- This is a building block for more complex problems: merge sort on linked lists needs the middle, and cycle detection uses the same two-pointer idea
