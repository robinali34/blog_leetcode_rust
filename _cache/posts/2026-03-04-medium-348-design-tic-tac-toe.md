Design a Tic-Tac-Toe game that is played on an `n x n` board between two players. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed. A player wins if they place `n` marks in a row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal.

Implement the `TicTacToe` class:
- `TicTacToe(int n)` -- initializes the board of size `n x n`
- `int move(int row, int col, int player)` -- player `1` or `2` places a mark. Return the player number if they win, otherwise `0`

## Examples

**Example:**

```
Input: ["TicTacToe","move","move","move","move","move","move","move"]
       [[3],[0,0,1],[0,2,2],[2,2,1],[1,1,2],[2,0,1],[1,0,2],[2,1,1]]
Output: [null,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]

Explanation:
  . . .    1 . .    1 . 2    1 . 2    1 . 2    1 . 2    1 . 2    1 . 2
  . . . -> . . . -> . . . -> . . . -> . 2 . -> 2 2 . -> 2 2 . -> 2 2 .
  . . .    . . .    . . .    . . 1    . . 1    . . 1    . . 1    1 1 1  ← player 1 wins
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `player` is `1` or `2`
- `0 <= row, col < n`
- Every call to `move` is on an empty cell
- At most `n²` calls to `move`

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Row/column traversal** *(this problem)* | O(nm) | O(1) | Simulation, spiral |
| BFS/DFS on grid | O(nm) | O(nm) | Islands, shortest path |
| Matrix as graph | O(nm) | O(nm) | 4/8-directional neighbors |
| Transpose / rotate | O(nm) | O(1) | In-place rotation tricks |

## Thinking Process

### Brute Force

After each move, scan the entire row, column, and both diagonals to check for a winner. Each `move` costs O(n).

### Key Insight: +1 / -1 Encoding

Instead of storing the full board, track the **sum** of each row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal:
- Player 1 contributes `+1`
- Player 2 contributes `-1`

If any sum reaches `+n`, player 1 wins. If any reaches `-n`, player 2 wins. This works because a sum of `±n` means all `n` cells in that line belong to the same player.

This makes each `move` O(1) -- just update at most 4 counters and check their absolute values.

### Why +1 / -1?

Using `+1` and `-1` is cleaner than tracking two separate counts per line. Opposite players cancel each other out, so `|sum| == n` is a necessary and sufficient condition for a win.

## Approach: Counter Tracking -- O(1) per move
```cpp
class TicTacToe {
public:
    TicTacToe(int n) : rows(n), cols(n), diagonal(0), antiDiagonal(0) {}

    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int curr = player == 1 ? 1 : -1;
        int n = rows.size();

        rows[row] += curr;
        cols[col] += curr;
        if (row == col) diagonal += curr;
        if (row == n - col - 1) antiDiagonal += curr;

        if (abs(rows[row]) == n || abs(cols[col]) == n ||
            abs(diagonal) == n || abs(antiDiagonal) == n)
            return player;
        return 0;
    }

private:
    vector<int> rows, cols;
    int diagonal, antiDiagonal;
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Row/column traversal (this problem)

**Key idea:** ### Brute Force

**How the code works:**
- Player 1 contributes `+1`
- Player 2 contributes `-1`
## Common Mistakes

- Using separate arrays for each player instead of the simpler `+1 / -1` encoding
- Forgetting the anti-diagonal condition (`row == n - col - 1`)
- Checking only diagonal when `row == col` but missing that some cells lie on **both** diagonals (e.g., the center of an odd-sized board)

## Key Takeaways

- **Reduce the board to counters** -- instead of storing an `n x n` grid, 2 arrays + 2 integers suffice
- The **+1 / -1 trick** turns a two-player game into simple summation, where `|sum| == n` detects a winner
- This pattern generalizes to any "check if a line is fully occupied by one player" problem
