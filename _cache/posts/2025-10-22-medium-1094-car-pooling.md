There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where `trips[i] = [numPassengers, from, to]` indicates that the `i`-th trip has `numPassengers` passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are `from` and `to` respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return `true` if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or `false` otherwise.

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
Explanation: 
- Trip 1: Pick up 2 passengers at location 1, drop off at location 5
- Trip 2: Pick up 3 passengers at location 3, drop off at location 5
- At location 3, we have 2 + 3 = 5 passengers, which exceeds capacity (4)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 
- Trip 1: Pick up 2 passengers at location 1, drop off at location 5
- Trip 2: Pick up 3 passengers at location 3, drop off at location 5
- At location 3, we have 2 + 3 = 5 passengers, which equals capacity (5)
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= trips.length <= 1000`
- `trips[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= numPassengers <= 100`
- `0 <= from < to <= 1000`

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Bucket Sort with Timestamps (Recommended)

**Key Insight:** Use a bucket array to track passenger changes at each timestamp. Add passengers at pickup locations and subtract at drop-off locations.

**Algorithm:**
1. Create a timestamp array of size 1001 (since locations are 0-1000)
2. For each trip, add passengers at pickup location and subtract at drop-off location
3. Iterate through timestamps and track cumulative passengers
4. Return false if capacity is exceeded at any point

**Time Complexity:** O(n + 1001) = O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1001) = O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool carPooling(vector<vector<int>>& trips, int capacity) {
        vector<int> timestamp(1001);
        for(auto& trip: trips) {
            timestamp[trip[1]] += trip[0];  // Pick up passengers
            timestamp[trip[2]] -= trip[0];  // Drop off passengers
        }
        int usedCapacity = 0;
        for(int number: timestamp) {
            usedCapacity += number;
            if(usedCapacity > capacity) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Prefix sum (this problem)

**Key idea:** Difficulty:** Medium

**How the code works:**
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Category:** Array, Sorting, Simulation
- Clarify if the array is sorted, has negatives, or allows duplicates.
- Prefix sums answer range queries; hash maps answer pair/count queries.
- In-place tricks use swap/write index instead of extra arrays.

**Walkthrough** — input `trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4`, expected output `false`:

- Trip 1: Pick up 2 passengers at location 1, drop off at location 5
- Trip 2: Pick up 3 passengers at location 3, drop off at location 5
- At location 3, we have 2 + 3 = 5 passengers, which exceeds capacity (4)
## Implementation Details

### Bucket Sort Technique
```cpp
// Add passengers at pickup location
timestamp[trip[1]] += trip[0];
// Remove passengers at drop-off location  
timestamp[trip[2]] -= trip[0];
```

### Event Processing
```cpp
// Process events in chronological order
for(int number: timestamp) {
    usedCapacity += number;
    if(usedCapacity > capacity) return false;
}
```

## Edge Cases

1. **Single Trip**: `[[1,0,1]]` with capacity 1 → true
2. **No Trips**: `[]` with any capacity → true
3. **Exact Capacity**: Passengers exactly equal capacity → true
4. **Overlapping Trips**: Multiple trips at same location → check total

## Follow-up Questions

- What if locations could be very large (up to 10^9)?
- How would you handle multiple cars?
- What if passengers could be picked up and dropped off at the same location?
- How would you optimize for very large numbers of trips?

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping edge cases (empty input, single element, boundaries).
- Off-by-one errors in loops and index ranges.
- Forgetting to handle the case when no valid answer exists.

## Optimization Techniques

1. **Bucket Sort**: Use array indexing for small ranges
2. **Event-Based Processing**: Treat state changes as events
3. **Early Termination**: Stop processing when constraint violated
4. **Space Optimization**: Use fixed-size arrays when possible

## Code Quality Notes

1. **Readability**: Bucket sort approach is most intuitive
2. **Performance**: O(n) time complexity is optimal
3. **Scalability**: Sorting approach works for any range
4. **Robustness**: All approaches handle edge cases correctly
