This is an **interactive problem**.

You are given an array of unique strings `words` where `words[i]` is six letters long. One word of `words` is chosen as `secret`.

You may call `Master.guess(word)` to guess a word. The guessed word should have type `string` and must be from the original array with 6 lowercase letters.

This function returns an `integer` representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the `secret` word. Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return `-1` instead.

For each test case, you have exactly 10 guesses to guess the word. If you have made 10 or fewer calls to `Master.guess` and at least one of them was the `secret`, you pass the test case.

## Thinking Process

1. **Elimination Strategy**: Use match count to eliminate impossible candidates

- Strings often need frequency maps or two-pointer scans.
- Watch index bounds and empty-string edge cases.
- Stack helps with nested or repeated patterns.

## Common Approaches

Typical techniques for this pattern:

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Two pointers on string** *(this problem)* | O(n) | O(1) | Palindrome, parsing |
| Hash map / frequency | O(n) | O(k) | Anagram, character counts |
| KMP / rolling hash | O(n) | O(n) | Pattern matching |
| Stack parsing | O(n) | O(n) | Decode string, parentheses |

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "acckzz", words = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"]
Explanation: master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist.
master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches.
master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches.
master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches.
master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.
We made 5 calls to master.guess and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: secret = "hamada", words = ["hamada","khaled"], numguesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `words[i].length == 6`
- `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `words` are **unique**.
- `secret` exists in `words`.
- `numguesses == 10`

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) worst case - In worst case, we might check all words in each iteration, but typically much better due to filtering
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - For the candidate set

## Optimization: Minimax Strategy

A more sophisticated approach is to pick the word that minimizes the maximum number of remaining candidates across all possible match counts:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void findSecretWord(vector<string>& words, Master& master) {
        vector<string> cand = words;
        while(!cand.empty()) {
            // Pick word that minimizes maximum remaining candidates
            string guess = cand[0];
            int minMax = cand.size();
            for(string word : cand) {
                vector<int> count(7, 0);
                for(string other : cand) {
                    count[match(word, other)]++;
                }
                int maxCount = *max_element(count.begin(), count.end());
                if(maxCount < minMax) {
                    minMax = maxCount;
                    guess = word;
                }
            }
            
            int matches = master.guess(guess);
            if(matches == 6) return;
            
            // Filter candidates
            vector<string> newCand;
            for(string word : cand) {
                if(match(word, guess) == matches) {
                    newCand.push_back(word);
                }
            }
            cand = newCand;
        }
    }

private:
    int match(const string& a, const string& b) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            cnt += (a[i] == b[i]);
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

This strategy picks the word that, in the worst case, leaves the fewest remaining candidates, leading to faster convergence.

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping edge cases (empty input, single element, boundaries).
- Off-by-one errors in loops and index ranges.
- Forgetting to handle the case when no valid answer exists.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Elimination Strategy**: Use match count to eliminate impossible candidates
2. **Match Function**: Count exact character matches at the same positions
3. **Filtering Logic**: If `match(word, guess) != matches`, then `word` cannot be the secret
4. **Guaranteed Success**: The algorithm will find the secret within 10 guesses since candidates are eliminated each round
5. **Word Selection**: The current solution picks the first candidate, but more sophisticated strategies (like picking the word that minimizes maximum remaining candidates) can be used
