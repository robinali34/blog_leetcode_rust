On a **single-threaded** CPU, we can only execute one function at a time. When a function call starts, it's recorded with a start timestamp. When a call ends, it's recorded with an end timestamp. Functions can call other functions, creating a call stack.

Given an integer `n` representing the number of functions, and an array `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `i-th` log message formatted as `"{function_id}:{"start"|"end"}:{timestamp}"`, return an array where each element is the exclusive time of that function.

**Exclusive time** is the sum of execution times for all calls to a function, excluding time spent calling other functions.

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
- Function 0 starts at 0 and ends at 6, taking 6 units total
- Function 0 calls function 1, which runs from 2 to 5 (3 units)
- Function 0 exclusive time: 6 - 3 = 3 units
- Function 1 exclusive time: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4 units (inclusive of end timestamp)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:end:6"]
Output: [3]
Explanation:
- First call: starts at 0, second call starts at 2
- Second call ends at 5 (duration 4)
- First call ends at 6 (duration 7 total, minus 4 from nested call = 3)
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:6","1:end:6","0:end:7"]
Output: [4,1]
Explanation:
- Function 0: recursive calls from 0-5 (3 units) + 6-7 (1 unit) = 4 total
- Function 1: runs at timestamp 6 (1 unit)
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= logs.length <= 500`
- `0 <= function_id < n`
- `0 <= timestamp <= 10^9`
- No two start events will happen at the same timestamp
- No two end events will happen at the same timestamp
- Each function call has a matching start and end event

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Stack-Based Time Tracking (Recommended)

**Key Insight:** Use a stack to track the current call stack. When a function starts, push it. When it ends, calculate its duration and subtract that time from its parent.

**Algorithm:**
1. Parse each log entry to extract function ID, action (start/end), and timestamp
2. Maintain a stack of active function calls
3. When a function **starts**: push to stack
4. When a function **ends**: 
   - Pop the top function and calculate its duration
   - Add duration to the function's exclusive time
   - Subtract duration from the parent function (if exists) in the stack

**Time Complexity:** O(m) where m is the number of logs  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the stack

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> exclusiveTime(int n, vector<string>& logs) {
        vector<int> rtn(n, 0);
        stack<pair<int, int>> st;  // {function_id, start_time}
        
        for(const string& log: logs) {
            int id = 0, time = 0;
            bool isStart = false;

            // Parse function ID
            int i = 0;
            while(log[i] != ':') {
                id = id * 10 + (log[i] - '0');
                i++;
            }
            i++;
            
            // Parse action (start or end)
            if(log[i] == 's') {
                isStart = true;
                i += 6;  // skip "start"
            } else {
                i += 4;  // skip "end"
            }
            
            // Parse timestamp
            while(i < (int) log.size()) {
                time = time * 10 + (log[i] - '0');
                i++;
            }
            
            if(isStart) {
                // Push function to stack
                st.push({id, time});
            } else {
                // Pop and calculate duration
                auto [funcId, startTime] = st.top();
                st.pop();
                int duration = time - startTime + 1;  // +1 to include end timestamp
                rtn[funcId] += duration;

                // Subtract from parent function
                if(!st.empty()) {
                    rtn[st.top().first] -= duration;
                }
            }
        }
        return rtn;
    }
};
```

### Solution Explanation

**Approach:** Monotonic stack (this problem)

**Key idea:** Difficulty:** Medium

**How the code works:**
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Category:** Stack, Parsing, Simulation
- Stack matches nested or LIFO structure (parentheses, monotonic scans).
- Push on open / larger; pop when the current element resolves pending work.
- Monotonic stack finds next greater/smaller in O(n).

**Walkthrough** — input `n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]`, expected output `[3,4]`:

- Function 0 starts at 0 and ends at 6, taking 6 units total
- Function 0 calls function 1, which runs from 2 to 5 (3 units)
- Function 0 exclusive time: 6 - 3 = 3 units
- Function 1 exclusive time: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4 units (inclusive of end timestamp)
## Implementation Details

### Manual String Parsing

```cpp
// Parse function ID (numeric string to int)
int id = 0;
while(log[i] != ':') {
    id = id * 10 + (log[i] - '0');
    i++;
}

// Check for "start" or "end"
if(log[i + 1] == 's') isStart = true;
```

### Stack Operations

```cpp
// Start event: push function onto stack
if(isStart) {
    st.push({id, time});
}

// End event: pop and calculate
else {
    auto [funcId, startTime] = st.top();
    st.pop();
    int duration = time - startTime + 1;
    rtn[funcId] += duration;
    
    // Subtract from parent
    if(!st.empty()) {
        rtn[st.top().first] -= duration;
    }
}
```

## Edge Cases

1. **Single Function**: Only one function, no nesting → straightforward timing
2. **Recursive Calls**: Same function called recursively → handled by stack
3. **Multiple Separate Calls**: Same function called at different times → duration summed
4. **Immediate Returns**: Start and end at same timestamp → duration = 1
5. **Deep Nesting**: Multiple levels of function calls → stack maintains hierarchy

## Follow-up Questions

- What if logs could be out of order?
- How would you handle multi-threaded execution?
- What if you needed to track inclusive time instead?
- How would you detect mismatched start/end events?

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping edge cases (empty input, single element, boundaries).
- Off-by-one errors in loops and index ranges.
- Forgetting to handle the case when no valid answer exists.

## Optimization Techniques

1. **Stack for Hierarchy**: Perfect data structure for call stack modeling
2. **Subtraction Trick**: Efficient way to calculate exclusive time
3. **Inclusive Counting**: End timestamp included in duration calculation
4. **Parent Tracking**: Stack automatically maintains parent information

## Code Quality Notes

1. **Readability**: Approach 1 with manual parsing is most educational
2. **Maintainability**: Approach 2 with stringstream is cleaner
3. **Performance**: All approaches are O(n) time and space
4. **Correctness**: Key insight is the subtraction from parent
